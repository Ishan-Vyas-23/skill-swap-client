      <h1>About Skill Swap</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Skill Swap</strong> is a platform built by passionate developer{" "}
        <strong>Ishan</strong> with a simple mission: connect people through the
        power of skills. Whether you're a coder, designer, musician, or magician
        — this space helps you showcase your expertise and discover others you
        can learn from or collaborate with.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Built This </h2>
      <p>
        As someone deeply into programming, problem-solving, and exploring tech,
        I wanted to create a project that wasn’t just about CRUD operations —
        but also about building real-world connections around skills.
        <br />
        So, instead of just another portfolio app, I built a full-stack MERN
        project with user authentication, dynamic skill sharing, and future
        plans for one-to-one skill swapping logic
      </p>

      <h2>Tech Stack </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontend:</strong> React + React Router + Toastify
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js + Express
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB + Mongoose
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auth:</strong> JWT-based authentication
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Coming Next </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> User dashboards with analytics</li>
        <li> Direct messaging between users</li>
        <li>Skill tags & categories for better discovery</li>
      </ul>
